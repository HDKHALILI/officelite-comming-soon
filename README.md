# Frontend Mentor - Officelite coming soon site

This is my solution to [Frontend Mentor's Officelite comming soon](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/officelite-coming-soon-site-M4DIPNz8g).

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this 2-page coming soon website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See error states when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name` and/or `Email Address` fields are empty
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly
- **Bonus**: See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- **Bonus**: See a custom-styled `select` form control in the sign-up form
